Prebid. js Ad Integration Project

Overview

This work shows how to implement responsive ads with Prebid.js. It comprises dynamic floor pricing, lazy loading, analytics, and fallback ads.

Features

- Dynamic Floor Pricing

- Lazy Loading for Ads

- Error Handling

- Bid Validation

- Analytics Integration

Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.

2. Add the Prebid.js file to .

3. Configure ad units in .

4. Open  in your browser.

Testing

1. To verify customized configurations and test individual features, please run /tests/test.js` or Prebid.js directly executing  in /header-bidding/Prebid.js` verifies that all settings are appropriate..

Run gulp test in /header-bidding/Prebid.js to ensure that Prebid.js integrations and bid adapter functionality are valid.

bash

cd /header-bidding/Prebid.js

gulp test

1. Core Tools and Libraries

Prebid.js: Prebid.js:

The main library for implementing header bidding. It manages bid requests and responses, integrates with SSPs, and has deployed auction logic.

Node.js: Node.js:

It is the runtime environment on which dependencies are managed, the build of the project and the execution of scripts are performed.

npm: npm:

Package manager for installing dependencies (e.g., Prebid.js, testing libraries).

2. Testing Tools

Jest: Jest:

Has been employed for unit and integration tests of custom configuration and features.

Gulp: Gulp:

Prebid. An integrated task runner in JavaScript to run testing, build project, and lifestyle process like linting.

Karma + Mocha/Chai: Karma + Mocha/Chai:

Testing tools used within Prebid.js for comprehensive testing of integrations.

3. Analytics Integration

Google Analytics / Matomo: Google Analytics / Matomo:

For tracking metrics like bids, win rates, and latency. (Choose one based on what you implemented.)

4. Development and Debugging Tools

Browserslist: Browserslist:

Ensures compatibility with various browser versions.

Webpack: Webpack:

Used for bundling the JavaScript files.

ESLint: ESLint:

For linting and maintaining code quality.

5. Deployment Tools

Git/GitHub: Git/GitHub:

System/service for code management and distribution, based on version control system and repository.

GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD:

Used for automating the deployment process.

6. Additional Tools (Optional Based on Requirements)

Lighthouse: Lighthouse:

For testing lazy-loading ads and monitoring website performance.

Postman: Postman:

It can be used for testing API integrations (for example, SSP and OpenRTB protocol requests).

OpenTelemetry: OpenTelemetry:

(If implemented) For monitoring and logging system performance.
