Prebid.js Ad Integration Project

 Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement responsive ads using Prebid.js. It includes dynamic floor pricing, lazy loading, analytics, and fallback ads.

 Features
- Dynamic Floor Pricing
- Lazy Loading for Ads
- Error Handling
- Bid Validation
- Analytics Integration

 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add the Prebid.js file to `/src/prebid/`.
3. Configure ad units in `/src/main.js`.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Testing
1. Run `/tests/test.js` to validate custom configurations and test specific features.
   ```bash
   npm test

 Testing
Run `gulp test` in `/header-bidding/Prebid.js` to ensure all configurations are correct.

Run gulp test in /header-bidding/Prebid.js to validate Prebid.js integrations and bid adapter functionality.
bash

cd /header-bidding/Prebid.js
gulp test

1. Core Tools and Libraries

Prebid.js: Prebid.js:

The main library for implementing header bidding. It controls bid requests and responses, integrates with SSPs, and implements auction logic.

Node.js: Node.js:

It is used as the underlying runtime environment for managing dependencies, build the project and run scripts.

npm: npm:

Package manager for installing dependencies (e.g., Prebid.js, testing libraries).

2. Testing Tools

Jest: Jest:

Used for writing and executing unit and integration tests over custom configuration and features.

Gulp: Gulp:

Prebid.js integrated task runner to execute test, build project, and worklife process, such as linting.

Karma + Mocha/Chai: Karma + Mocha/Chai:

Testing tools used within Prebid.js for comprehensive testing of integrations.

3. Analytics Integration

Google Analytics / Matomo: Google Analytics / Matomo:

For tracking metrics like bids, win rates, and latency. (Choose one based on what you implemented.)

4. Development and Debugging Tools

Browserslist: Browserslist:

Ensures compatibility with various browser versions.

Webpack: Webpack:

Used for bundling the JavaScript files.

ESLint: ESLint:

For linting and maintaining code quality.

5. Deployment Tools

Git/GitHub: Git/GitHub:

Code managment and sharing system/service based on version control system and repository.

GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD:

Used for automating the deployment process.

6. Additional Tools (Optional Based on Requirements)
